# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

## How the Game Works

- You can select the image for the player character before starting the game either by clicking on the character or you can use the TAB key to move to another character and then press ENTER
- The player can move left, right, up and down
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
- You can pause and restart the game by pressing 'p' key.
- There is a constant number of enemies (5). However, their position and speed is generated. You can always generate them anew by clicking on the reset icon under the board.
